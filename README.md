# Product_Sales_Analysis
Designed compelling and interactive reports and dashboards on given data by using different visualizations methods in MS Power BI

The data used here is provided by Adventure Works. It is first segregated on the basis of total balance, country, date, month, year, quarter, etc to analyse the data on a variety of parameters. Then, filtered out the top ten resellers, product, sub-category on the basis of country and date. Finally, developed an app on Power BI to share the report for viewing and configured the enterprise and personal gateway.
